**What:**  _Pulse-Width Modulation_ was used to obtain multple colours using an RGB LED. _Nested for-loops_ were used to go through all the possible colours from RGB(255, 0, 0) to RGB(255, 255, 255). <br />

**Explanation:** Pulse-Width Modulation is the process of turning on and off a digital signal. The signal appears to be a constant voltage which equals the average voltage of the pulse wave. The _duty cycle_ is the percentage of time the digital signal is on in a single period and this determines the average voltage: average voltage = duty cycle x max voltage.
