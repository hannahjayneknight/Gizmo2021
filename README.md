# Gizmo2021

A repository containing my solutions to all the tutorials and my final project for this module.

## Week 1 - Exploring Arduino and the starter kit
Simple exercises to get used to using the arduino environment. Exercises involved using LEDs, a keypad and the serial monitor. <br />

No notes for this week yet.

## Week 2 - Controlling motors and other actuators
More simple exercises to get used to using the arduino environment. Exercises involved using an RBG LED, a servo motor and a DC motor.

No notes for this week yet.

## Week 3 - Working with sensors
Task 1 - Using the sound sensor to detect my voice and light up the RGB different colours depending on the pressure measured. <br />

Task 2 - Calibrating the sound sensor to the user. <br />

Task 3 - Using an ultrasonic sensor to measure the distance between an object and the sensor. The precision of the sensor was then found. <br />
