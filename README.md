# Gizmo2021

A repository containing my solutions to all the tutorials and my final project for this module.

## Week 1 - Exploring Arduino and the starter kit
Simple exercises to get used to using the arduino environment. Exercises involved using LEDs, resisors, a potentiometer, an RGB LED and a keypad and the serial monitor. <br />

## Week 2 - Controlling motors and other actuators
**Task 1:** Controlling the colours emitted by an RGB. <br />

**Task 2:** Controlling the angle and time held by a servo. <br />

**Task 3:** Controlling the speed of a DC motor and allowing a user to input a speed. <br />

## Week 3 - Working with sensors
**Task 1:** Using the sound sensor to detect my voice and light up the RGB different colours depending on the pressure measured. <br />

**Task 2:** Calibrating the sound sensor to the user. <br />

**Task 3:** Using an ultrasonic sensor to measure the distance between an object and the sensor. The precision of the sensor was then found. <br />

## Week 4 - Dealing with a concurrent physical world
**Task 1:**  Using a title sensor to react to changes in orientation. <br />

**Task 2:** <br />

**Task 3:**  <br />
